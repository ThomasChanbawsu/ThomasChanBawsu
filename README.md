### Hi there 👋

My name is Thomas and if you read my bio, I am currently a third year MPhys student doing my physics degree in the University of Manchester. I chose physics simply because I love the logical and experimental thinking in investigating the physical phenomena around us, 
thus developing an idea based on our foundings.
Currently, my interests are in condensed matter field, particularly aspects in quantum information theory and structures in semiconductors and superconductors. The exciting potential in building powerful techs such as quantum computers based from these relevant ideas are what attracted to me to this area. I envision that I can work in a related research in the future.


Here are a list of selected Experiments I have done which I find interesting.
## Selected experiments

### Low Temperature Resistance

This experiment was performed in the aims of investigating the response in conductivity of different materials from a huge range of temperatures. Four different materials were used, including copper, constantan, germanium and silicon diode. The materials were cooled to very low temperatures (~100 K) with the use of liquid nitrogen as a cryogenic. 
After the resistance of the materials were measured at different temperatures, they were converted into conductivity and plotted over the recipricol of the temperature. During this process, the band structure of the materials were studied and categorised into conductors and semiconductors. 
The energy gap of germanium and silicon diode was also measured by computing a resistance-temperature graph and putting an exponential fit to it with parameters 

From this experiment, I have earned the chance to handle liquid nitrogen with safety knowledge and carried out risk assessment, which was a fun learning opportunity. I have also studied thoroughly the mechanism behind a semiconductor's structure, which was responsible behind its conducting properties. 
Because of this, I have gained some appreciation in semiconductors, as I realize they are the 'brain network' behind many smart devices that we nowaday use.

### Analysing the events of Z boson with the ATLAS data

This experiment was carried out in the aims of verifying decaying processes predicted by our current standard model of Particle Physics. The ATLAS opendata (for center of mass energy at 13 TeV) was borrowed along with Monte Carlo simulations given to us.
The signal decaying process we were interested was the leptonic channel of the Z boson decaying to two same flavour, opposite charge leptons. The monte carlo predictions were compared to the ATLAS data in order to detect excess background data and filter them out. A final estimate for the cross section of the process was then obtained based on our finalised cuts.

Here, I have acquired certain valuable data analysis skills which may prove to be helpful in data filtering. Me and my partner have utilised a data-driven background method to detect and remove excess jet signs in our data. This was very helpful in our experiment as jet processes were hard to be determined based from our data alone.
I have also learned using the ROOT documentation in this experiment which is a documentation provided for particle physicist in this standard age to process and plot their histogram data of the detections of particles they received in their detectors.
This experiment certainly helped me improve my data analysis skills as well as challenged my computing skills.
